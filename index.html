   <h1>Christian Speelman</h1>
   <p>Hello everyone, my name is Christian Speelman. I am currently living in Rexburg, ID. I live most of my life in a small town in North Idaho called Cataldo.
      Fun fact, that town has the oldest building that is still standing in Idaho. I am a 2nd year at BYUI and am currently majoring in computer programming.
      I plan to go into either game or software development. I enjoy coding games for fun, and have launched a couple of apps on the google store and app store.
      I am usually available Wednesday through Friday, 8am-6pm, and get a lot of work done in the morning. I got married 1 year ago to my wonderful wife Jenny
