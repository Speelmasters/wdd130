                     Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?

                  <div class="answer">
                     <p>Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however that children
                        over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall
                        (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are all over 8). A common concern we get
                        from parents is that their children will be
                        bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time. Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of
                        any age. The areas we are rafting through are
                        some of the most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you might see around any
                        corner. Not to mention the rapids which keep things
                        very interesting. Each boat also comes equipped with a guide. It has been proven that river
                        guides are unable to go for very long at all without
                        telling stories...some of which are even true!</p>

                     <p>As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk.
                        To help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start
                        with at least 3 years of rafting experience.
                        The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land.
                        Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation
                        device (PFD).
                        Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. Your guide will give you an in
                        depth and engaging safety talk before your
                        trip begins explaining what you should prepare for and do in the event that you fall out of the
                        raft.</p>

                     <p>Are you kidding me! What's not great about whitewater rafting!...Let's describe a common day on
                        the river.
                        Arise in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping under a beautiful
                        starry sky. Have a hearty warm breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes
                        or omelets to order, then pack your things and prepare for the day. The day is filled with some
                        combination of swift water, rapids, calms, hikes, history, geology,
                        stories, and more good food. We try to hit camp around 4 or 5, after setting up your cot you can
                        relax with a good book or good company by the river, or explore
                        around camp while your guides prepare your dinner...something perhaps like steak and potatoes,
                        or grilled salmon...and dutch oven brownies...you won't forget the
                        dutch oven brownies. After dinner it's more relaxing, and you might even be able to talk your
                        guide into another story or two to send you off to bed under more
                        stars than you thought were possible.</p>
